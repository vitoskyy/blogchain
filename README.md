# blogchain
Blogchain is more than a simple blog.
Users can access and register on the website, post their thoughts and view other people'posts.
Every post is uploaded on Ropsten Blockchain (Ethereum Testnet) as proof of his existence at a certain time.
There are detailed pages on users and posts (JSON and HTML) and exclusive pages for admins.
For this project I used Django, a high-level Python Web framework, for the Back-end and HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for the Front-end.
The main database is SQLite, but I also implemented a caching system with Redis to make the webiste loading faster.
